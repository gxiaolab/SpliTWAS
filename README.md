# SpliTWAS

SpliTWAS is framework that associates the genetically driven complexity of alternative RNA processing to disease. 

SpliTWAS examines alternative splicing patterns to identify splicing-trait associations which are then fine-mapped at both the gene and exon levels. The degree of alternative splicing of an exon is quantified through percent spliced in (PSI), which indicates the level of exon inclusion in the transcriptpopulation of a gene, allowing an exon-centric view of the transcriptome. 

### PSI Calculation

First, PSI is calculated using the set of scripts and annotations described in: [PSI_Calculator](https://github.com/gxiaolab/PSI_calculator)
